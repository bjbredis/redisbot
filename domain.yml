        Happy to help. Our license model is based on shards of your data set. 
        * A shard is unit that represents a segment of your data. 
        * We help you understand the number of shards you need based on the following:
           - Estimated size of data set (in gigabytes)
           - Estimated throughput measured in Redis operations per second (example: 1k ops/sec, 50k ops/sec)
           - The number of production environments and non prod environments you would like supported.
           - Based on best practices gathered over the years, a single production shard can support up to ~20GB and ~20k ops/sec
        To save you some money, we do not need to license all of your infrastructure, just your active data set.
